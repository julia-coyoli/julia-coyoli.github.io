								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am a PhD Candidate in Government at Harvard University, where I am affiliated with the <a href="https://wcfia.harvard.edu/">Weatherhead Center for International Affairs</a> and the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>. I work in the fields of comparative politics and public policy, with a substantive focus on social policy, bureaucratic politics, and state-society relations, and a regional focus on Latin America.</p>
								<p>In my dissertation book project I investigate when, why, and how subnational policymakers implement social policy reforms in developing democracies through a mixed-methods study of the implementation of an education reform in Mexican states.</p>
								<p>I earned a BA in Latin American Studies and Educational Studies from Macalester College (St. Paul, MN) and an MSc in Economics from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (Mexico City). I am a former Fulbright IEE scholar and Princeton in Latin America fellow. I have spent significant time in Mexico City and Mérida, Mexico, Lima, Peru, Managua, Nicaragua, and São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
								<p>I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have designed and taught original courses in the political economy of education, economic development, and teaching social sciences. I have also served as a teaching fellow for courses in comparative and Latin American politics and have advised six undergraduate theses. I am the recipient of the Sidney Verba Prize for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the Harvard Government Department Peer Mentorship Award,  and the Derek C. Bok Certificate of Distinction in Teaching.</p>
								<p>Outside of academia, I enjoy reading fiction with friends (most recently, Cloud Cuckoo Land by Anthony Doerr) and cooking Mexican food (chiles en nogada, pictured below, are my specialty)</p>

								<p>As a scholar of comparative politics and public policy, I am interested in the ways in which regime and electoral dynamics, as well as civil society, shape the degree to which social policies affect the populations they are designed to help. While much of the political science literature has focused on explaining policy passage, my research turns our attention, instead, to what happens on the ground. </p>
								<p>In my dissertation book project, I investigate when, why, and how subnational policymakers implement social policy reforms in developing democracies. Countries in the Global South have frequently relied on partnerships with societal groups, resulting in bolstered capacity via coproduction. This path, however, would seem impossible for the plethora of reforms that powerful civil society organizations oppose. In my work, I find that this is not the case; implementation can and does occur, even in these challenging circumstances.</p>
								<p>I argue that the degree of implementation is a function, not of the politician’s incentives, but rather of how societal actors are organized and the reasons that they oppose the policy in question. The highest degree of implementation occurs when one organization represents everyone who needs to comply with the reform and that organization opposes the costs the process of implementation poses on its members, but not the reform’s goals themselves. Under these circumstances, sanctioning non-compliance is ineffective at achieving any implementation, leading politicians to instead offer organizations benefits in exchange for their support in policy implementation. The fact that the organization’s concerns stem mainly from the costs the implementation process imposes on them and their members, makes it likely that they will agree to accept the offer.  In contrast, when the organization opposes anyone implementing the policy, they are much less likely to accept the offer. When accepted, this exchange results in a high degree of implementation, as the organization can both provide material resources to bolster implementation, while increasing the likelihood that its members will comply.</p>
								<p>I test my argument using a mixed-methods study of the case of an education quality reform passed in Mexico in 2013 that required all current and future teachers participate in a meritocratic process in order to get and keep teaching jobs. Using original data about the rate of implementation, union fragmentation, reasons for opposition, and the government's strategy to implement from Mexico's 31 states,  I show that my argument can explain the implementation outcomes across the country. I also show that my argument outperforms existing explanations for implementation, namely that states aligned with the federal government have better implementation than non-aligned ones. I draw on elite interviews that I conducted with Governors, Secretaries of Education, union leaders, and education bureaucrats in the states of Coahuila, Puebla, and Oaxaca to illustrate the mechanisms in my argument. My findings have important implications for how we understand the politics of policy implementation and the politics of education. Of particular note is the finding that weak states can implement policy even when they face opposition from strong, organized societal actors; in fact, a higher degree of implementation is more likely in this case.</p>
								<p>In other work, co-authored with <a href="https://www.utdt.edu/ver_contenido.php?id_contenido=22684&id_item_menu=37592">Candelaria Garay</a> (under review), I explore how subnational regime dynamics shape the decisions that local governments make regarding healthcare provision and quality. Using evidence from Argentina, we find that less democratic regimes have higher infant mortality rates. Our results show that this effect is driven by provinces where governors are eligible for indefinite reelection. We also find that regime type has no impact on the provision of health services. However, protest, regardless of the subnational regime, has a positive impact on health service provision. In another project, co-authored with <a href="https://www.emmerichdavies.com/">Emmerich Davies</a>, <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/lesliefinger/home">Leslie Finger</a>, and <a href="https://jonnyphillips.github.io/Website/">Jonathan Phillips</a> (currently in the data collection phase), I study the factors that shape the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that public sector frontline providers hold. Through a regression discontinuity design coupled with an original survey of teachers in Brazil, we seek to understand both whether public sector employees differ in their beliefs from those who almost became public sector employees, as well as what aspect of this experience explains these different beliefs.</p>
								<p>I am also interested in research about innovations in teaching and learning political science. In addition to my work as the Pedagogy Fellow for the Government Department, <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/politicalscience/facultystaff/pauldosh/">Paul Dosh</a> and I have published in <i>PS: Political Science & Politics</i> about collaborating with undergraduates to produce political science research that involves significant fieldwork and results in a peer reviewed article. </p>

								<p>I have served as both the Pedagogy Fellow and Writing Fellow for Harvard’s Government Department. I have also advised six undergraduate theses in Government, on topics in Latin American politics, public health, urban politics, education policy, and authoritarian strategy. With <a href="https://www.jessietrudeau.com/">Jessie Trudeau</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.harvard.edu/directory/nara-dillon/">Nara Dillon</a>, I designed and led workshops on gender and fieldwork in political science, for both graduate and undergraduate students. </p>
								<p>I have taught in many non-traditional spaces. In both St. Paul, Minnesota and Boston, I taught English to non-native speakers. I have taught both Spanish and human rights through afterschool programming to elementary school students.  As a Princeton in Latin America fellow, I taught leadership seminars for teenagers and local leaders in Lima’s informal settlements.</p>
